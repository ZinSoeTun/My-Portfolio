                                          My name is Zin Soe Tun . I was born in 2006 so I am 18 years old now.
                                          I am from myanmar (burma) . I live in Mandalay , the second largest city
                                          of our country. My personality is bright, smart and flexible in environment.
                                          I have one younger brother . I have five members of family including me .
                                          They are my father ,my mother , my grandmother , my younger brother and me.
                                          I have not finished my high school level yet because I quitted my school
                                          becaause of
                                          some reason . But I have finished G.E.D (General Educational Development) in
                                          2022 instead of
                                          High School. After finishing my G.E.D then I entered UOPeople University
                                          <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/">UOPeople</a> as a Scholarship Student .
                                          While starting my university student life , I also stared to settle down into
                                          IT fields .
                                          Now I have been over two years and will be three years into this field and
                                          also have gotten graduate
                                          certificate . So now I am a gratuated student.
                                          I took one class for web deveopment and it also changes my life as well.
                                          Then I started my web developer carrier as a freelancer . At first I
                                          experienced
                                          many difficulties and problems also our family social stuffs and economics
                                          cache.
                                          But I passed through this all stuffs and today I was here. My Length is spirit
                                          of never
                                          give up , having strong heart and sharp decision . These pushed me today what
                                          I am .
                                          My MBTI is ISTJ . I also can speak different languages like english , Korean
                                          .....
                                          I also have plans learning continuously. At the present I can use different
                                          programming languages
                                          such as React and Laravel . I am a laravel developer but I also into React
                                          because I like
                                          React's file structure and if only one html page you can write different page
                                          . I can understand
                                          Python, Java but have never written with these language. I can be familier with react
                                          so I can also understand
                                          TypeScript but this also has been never used in project and also I am learning Vue.
